# Play-Store-App-Review-Analysis

## introduction

Application distribution platform, for example, Play Store gets overwhelmed with millions of new applications being launched on the platform regularly. Lots of designers and developers work on it to make an app successful on the Play Store. In this highly competitive world, it is an immense challenge for a developer to know whether they are focusing on the right path to make their app successful on the platform. To launch themselves successfully and create an identity for themselves in this oversaturated market, they need to ensure that majority of the essential factors are incorporated while designing and developing an app that would play an important role in customer's decision-making process. However, the lack of a clear understanding of the inner working and dynamic of popular app markets impacts both the developers and users.

In this project of analyzing play store applications, we have worked on several parameters which would help MNC to do well in launching their apps on the play store.

In the initial phase, we focused more on the problem statements and data cleaning, in order to ensure that we give them the best results out of our analysis.


# conclusion 
MNC needs to focus more on:

1. Developing apps related to the least categories as they are not explored much. Like events and beauty.
2. Most of the apps are Free, so focusing on free app is more important.
3. Focusing more on content available for Everyone will increase the chances of getting the highest installs.
4. They need to focus on updating their apps regularly, so that it will attract more users.
5. They need to keep in mind that the sentiments of the user keep varying as they keep using the app, so they should focus more on users needs and features.
